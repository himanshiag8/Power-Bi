☕ Coffee Quality Analysis 📊

# 🚀 Project Overview
  This project delves into the intricate world of coffee quality, analyzing sensory attributes, processing methods, regional factors, and defects using data from the Coffee     Quality Institute (CQI). The goal is to uncover how these elements impact the overall coffee quality score, known as Total Cup Points.

# 🎯 Objectives
  * Uncover the key sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, acidity) that determine coffee quality.
  * Explore the correlation between coffee origins, processing methods, and quality scores.
  * Analyze defect patterns and their effect on coffee quality.
  * Provide actionable insights to improve coffee production and quality.

# 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset from CQI contains:

  * Sensory Evaluations: Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Sweetness, Aftertaste, Clean Cup.
  * Defects: Category One (visual defects) and Category Two (taste defects).
  * Processing Methods: Washed/Wet, Natural/Dry, Honey, etc.
  * Origins: Country of origin, harvest year, grading year, and coffee variety.

# 🔍 Key Insights
1. Sensory Attributes Analysis ☕
  * 🌟 Flavor, Aroma, and Acidity have the strongest positive impact on Total Cup Points.
  *  Processing methods like Double Anaerobic Washed and Honey, Mossto consistently enhance quality, yielding higher scores.
2. Region Analysis 🌍
  * Thailand leads with the highest average coffee quality scores.
  * Ethiopia, despite being a major producer, could benefit from improving quality control to boost average scores.
3. Defect Analysis ❌
  * The Washed/Wet method has the highest number of defects, especially in Category Two (taste defects).
  * Higher moisture content (>10%) correlates with more defects, emphasizing the need for moisture control.
4. Variety Analysis 🌱
  * Varieties like Castillo and Red Bourbon show consistent quality across countries, highlighting robust cultivation and processing practices.

# 🔑 Key Findings
* Top Sensory Performers: Attributes like Flavor, Aroma, and Acidity significantly influence overall quality scores.
* Defect Trends: Wet-processed beans with higher moisture content show more defects.
* Regional Excellence: Thailand and Brazil’s Minas Gerais region demonstrate superior cultivation and processing methods, producing higher quality beans.
* Star Varieties: Castillo and Red Bourbon lead in coffee quality across regions.

# 💡 Recommendations
* Boost Sensory Attributes: Focus on improving the Flavor, Aroma, and Acidity of the coffee to enhance overall quality.
* Learn from Top Regions: Regions with consistently high scores (e.g., Thailand) should serve as models for others to adopt best practices.
* Strengthen Defect Control: Implement stricter moisture management and defect reduction techniques, especially for wet-processed coffee beans.

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies
* Power BI: For creating impactful visualizations and exploring data trends.

# 🔮 Conclusion
  * This project provides valuable insights into what makes high-quality coffee. By focusing on key sensory attributes, adopting best practices from top-performing regions,      and minimizing defects, coffee producers can elevate their product’s quality and increase market competitiveness.
